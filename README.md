===== Inside the app =====

Once the app is up and running you will get to the home page directly where it will display the list of shows.
 
On the top -right corner you will see a search icon where you can search for an specific show you are looking for. If there are no matches maybe you can try with another show.

Clicking on a show wether you are doing a search or just taking a peak over the show list at the home page and the app will take you to the show details. Here you can read about the show. If you want to check out the seasons episodes you click over "Seasons & episodes" button.

In the Seasons & episodes section you will be able to select the season you want and it will automatically display for you the episodes for that season.It can contain extra episodes too!!
